  <h1><em>Hobbies</em></h1>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>One of my hobbies is working.</strong> Yes, you read that correctly.
    I love walking into work knowing that I have the power to make every day a fulfilling and
    productive one, especially when a major part of my day is <em>getting to interact with people.</em> </p>

  <h3>Traveling</h3>
  <p>
    To date, I've been to around half of the United States, explored Mexico ever-so-slightly, and am now living in Australia!
    No matter where I'm based, I enjoy branching out in my free time, exploring, and finding hidden treasures; There's beauty everywhere,
    but the most beautiful thing is experiencing as much of it as possible.

  <h3>Hiking, Camping, and Outdoor Activites</h3>
  <p>
    Yeah, it can <em>kinda</em> be grouped in traveling, and yeah, it's a pretty basic hobby, but I find there's nothing more freeing than
    getting lost. When I was staying in the Daintree Rainforest, I parked my rental car at a carpark and found a unpaved trail nearby, claiming
    to be a .5km, 30-minute long hike... 90 minutes later, I'm alone and confused, cheap sandals on my feet, in the middle of the jungle, following a 6-inch wide, barely
    beaten-down path winding its way up and down ravines, over creeks, and further and further away from civilization. It was only when I stopped and took a look around
    that I realized: <em>"this</em> is what I've been chasing". Totally alone, no echo of highways and people, just me and the Earth. I heard animals and noises I had never heard before,
    witnessed nature in its truest form, and even spotted some <strong>cassowaries</strong>, an elusive, dinosaur-era bird native to Australia's rainforests. It's the only time I've ever
    that overpowering sense of isolation, and it's a feeling I cherish and refernece often in my daily life.
